# DJSetPlanner

DJ Set Planner is going to a web application project to help others and myself plan DJ sets. It will do this by utilizing music library API's to retrieve song data. It will then help the DJ find other tracks based on criteria such as BPM, key, artist name, happiness and energy levels, etc. 

DJ Set Planner is built in React using the NextJS framework. This means it'll be React front-end, NextJS on top of Express for the server-side and it will utilize either MongoDB or mySQL (tbd). DJ Set Planner is going to use some common stack tools such as webpack and babel to package and bundle code from the server instead of rendering client side.
