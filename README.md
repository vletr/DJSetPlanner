# DJSetPlanner

DJ Set Planner is going to a web application project to help others and myself plan DJ sets. It will do this by utilizing music library API's to retrieve song data. It will then help the DJ find other tracks based on criteria such as BPM, key, artist name, happiness and energy levels, etc. 
DJ's will be able to save playlists in order to build out their sets. Potenially we may add other features such as friends lists.
